The idea of this task is to be able to query, update and delete data from a leasing agency database within a web page. A statement is uploaded that indicates how the leasing agency works, the entity-relationship model and within the folder "Trabajo_final" is all the development to update, delete and query data.

It is necessary to install wamp server to create the database and access it through localhost.
